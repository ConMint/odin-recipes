    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These air fried corn ribs are reminiscent of Mexican street corn, but each ear is split into quarters and then air fried. I used frozen corn on the cob which I thawed. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears corn on the cob</li>
        <li>3 tbspoons "Everything but the Elote seasoning" (Trader Joe's®), divided </li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray </li>
        <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).</li>
        <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.</li>
        <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
        
    </ol>
